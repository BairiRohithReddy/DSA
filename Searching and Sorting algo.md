#### **Sorting algorithms**: Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a list of items in a specific order. 
##### common sorting algorithms include: 
1. **Bubble sort**: This algorithm repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the list is sorted. 
2. **Selection sort**: This algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element in the unsorted portion of 
the list and moves it to the beginning of the sorted portion. 
3. **Insertion sort**: This algorithm builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list. 
4. **Merge sort**: This algorithm divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts each sublist recursively, and then merges the sorted sublists back together. 
5. **Quick sort**: This algorithm selects a pivot element, partitions the list into elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot, and then sorts the two partitions recursively. 

#### **Search algorithms**: Search algorithms are used to find a specific item in a list or data structure. 
##### common search algorithms include: 
1. **Linear search**: This algorithm checks each element in the list sequentially until the target element is found. 
2. **Binary search**: This algorithm works on a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the list in half and 
checking whether the target element is in the left or right half. 
3. **Depth-first search (DFS)**: This algorithm traverses a graph in depth-first order, visiting all the vertices in a path before backtracking and visiting other paths. 
4. **Breadth-first search (BFS)**: This algorithm traverses a graph in breadth-first order, visiting all the vertices at a given distance from the starting vertex before moving on to vertices at a greater 
distance.
