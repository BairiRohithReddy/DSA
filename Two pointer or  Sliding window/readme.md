1. Constant Window
2. Longest subarray or substring with a condition
 - Example:
    - Longest subarray with sum = k
3. Number of subarrays where a <condition>
 - Example:
    - No of subarrays with sum = k
4. Shortest / minimum window with a <condition>

The three approaches to solve these problems:
 - Brute Force
    - finding all the sub arrays
 - Better Solution
    - expanding and shrinking
 - Optimal approach
    - using a if condition to make sure we are not shrinking more than needed
