Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm, is a clever technique used to detect cycles in sequences or linked structures. Here's an explanation of how it works and its application to the problem of finding a duplicate number:

## Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

### Key Concepts:

1. **Two Pointers**: The algorithm uses two pointers, often called "tortoise" (slow) and "hare" (fast).

2. **Different Speeds**: The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps.

3. **Cycle Detection**: If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer within the cycle.

### How It Works:

1. **Phase 1: Detecting the Cycle**
   - Initialize both pointers to the start of the sequence.
   - Move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps in each iteration.
   - If they meet, a cycle exists.

2. **Phase 2: Finding the Cycle Start**
   - Reset the slow pointer to the start of the sequence.
   - Keep the fast pointer at the meeting point.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again.
   - The meeting point is the start of the cycle.

### Mathematical Intuition:

- Let F be the distance to the cycle entrance, C be the cycle length, and k be some integer.
- When the pointers meet, the slow pointer has traveled F + a distance, while the fast pointer has traveled F + kC + a.
- Since the fast pointer moves twice as fast: 2(F + a) = F + kC + a
- Solving this equation: F = kC - a
- This means the distance from the start to the cycle entrance (F) is equal to some multiple of the cycle length minus the meeting point distance within the cycle.

## Application to Finding the Duplicate Number

In the context of LeetCode problem 287 (Find the Duplicate Number):

1. Treat the array as a linked list where nums[i] points to the index nums[i].
2. The duplicate number creates a cycle in this virtual linked list.
3. Apply Floyd's algorithm to find the start of the cycle, which is the duplicate number.

### Python Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Phase 1: Detecting the cycle
        slow = fast = nums[0]
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        # Phase 2: Finding the cycle start (duplicate number)
        slow = nums[0]
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]
        
        return slow
```

This algorithm efficiently solves the problem with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, meeting the problem's constraints.
